    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Micayela. I studied communications and am currently working in the kitchen of one of my favorite restaurants and doing some soical media management. I decided to take a class on programing to help me to be more financially stable. One of my favorite things to do is cook. While I work in a kitchen, I also love to spend my time at home trying new recipes or learning about new ingredients. I also love to travel and am hoping it won't be too long before it is safe to do so again. </p>
